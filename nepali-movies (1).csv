From a family finance supported by money sent by a young son or husband from abroad to a society without any other means of income, there seems to be no way of knowing where the problem begins and ends. The only thing we can do is revisit the present situation of immigration, which is a result of a vicious cycle of individual danger, pain, agitation, fear, and repeated migration. It's not easy for the naive citizens of Nepal who grew up in a feudal agricultural society to delve into the capitalistic economy. What if the agency that introduced foreign employers is a fraud? What if their wage is delayed? What happens to a family without its head for years? What if the money from foreign lands is gone again? Not knowing what will happen next, the citizens of Nepal live another day chasing after the mirage of foreign laborers. Can they really find riyal?"

However, their life together takes an unexpected turn as the all too common reality of community expectations, peer pressure and family pressures set in. How should they respond? We first see the couple listening to those around them rather than to each other. They argue more and the distance and suspicions between them grow, until the shocking climax of the film shows just how wrong things can go between a husband and a wife. Take two, the film rewinds and this time the couple stay united despite the same pressures from friends and family. This time there is no shocking climax, at each juncture the couple try to talk and listen to each other and as a result are happier and their marriage is stronger. By showing how two approaches towards the daily pressures faced by a married couple can have such dramatically different consequences, the film asks audiences to reflect on their role in the success of their own marriage. Can happiness & mutual understanding between husband and wife rest in our own hands?"
